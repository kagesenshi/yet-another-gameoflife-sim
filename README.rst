System Details
================

This project is built on top of a thin, experimental component based web 
application & dashboard framework, Pysiphae, on top of Pyramid.

Pysiphae attempts to simplify developer workflow for common/repetitive 
projects through taking care of common web application functionalities 
(authentication, theme, security) through introducing plugin based 
architecture, and code generators for boilerplates.

Ideally developer should only have to worry about their plugin rather than
the whole system.

This application is an example application built on pysiphae which includes:

 * a gameoflife simulator
 * and a url shortener application
